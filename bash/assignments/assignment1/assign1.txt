    a. Create a file "DAtA1.txt"
     $ vi DATA1.txt
   
    b) save the file and exit from the vi editor
    -> wq! 

    c) Write some text and save it to a file "MyData2.txt"
    -> echo "This is vi editor" > MyData2.txt

    d) Repeat point (c) but after writing some text dont save and just exit "vi"
    -> q!  (it won't save any changed data)

   c) Move the first three lines of the file to the end of the file  (Linux terminal)
   -> dac@dac-Veriton-M200-H310:~$ sed '1,3{H;d}; ${p;x;s/^\n//}' MyData2.txt 
      Unix file structure is hierarchical liek an upside down tree.
      Regular files cannot contain another file,or directory.
